## 文件描述符
##### 0, 1, 2 文件描述符(fd)

- 0 is standard in (stdin),1 is standard out (stdout), and file descriptor 2 is standard error (stderr).
- STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, and STDERR_FILENO in C std lib, by default, keyboard, terminal's display

##### fd与文件

- fd refer to regular file, device files, pips

##### 进程文件表

- a process's file table, contains open files and their access mode, current file position, and other metadata, a child process receives a copy of its parent's file table, which means file operations in one process doesn't affect the other. 

##### fd重定向

- redirect the std fd, pipe the output of one program into another

## 新创建的文件
##### 文件的用户访问权限

- owner user is the uid of process creating the file
- owner group could be the gid of process creating file, or maybe the gid of the parent directory

##### 设置文件访问权限，读写和执行

- file access permission can be set through mode bitset
- by default '0644', owner can read and write, everyone else can only read
- '0700' executable by owner
- permission is a process-specific attribute set via login shell

## 写文件的过程
##### 文件推迟写

- when call of write() returns, the kernel has copied the data from supplied buffer to a kernel buffer, however, there is no guarantee that data would be written to its destination (system calls return much faster than this happens due to the disparity in performance between processor and hard disk)

##### 内核回写文件

- kernel gathers up all the dirty buffers (buffers that contain data newer than what is on disk), sort them optimally and writes them to the disk (so called writeback), therefore, kernel actually defer writes to more idle periods and batch many writes together (delayed writes)

##### 内核读缓存

- when read is issued for a piece of just-written data that only lives in buffer (in-memory cache) rather than disk, that request will directly satisfied from the buffer and not cause read from disk. However, this is just the results as expected, if system does not crash before data makes it to disk.

##### 内核写顺序

- write ordering may take cared by application and kernel will reorder the write requests asit sees fit(for reason of performance), all request would hit the disk. the ordering for database is a concern, they need to ensure the write order, therefore, database file write need to be sync

##### I/O错误

- I/O errors, I/O errors occur during writeback have no chance to be reported back to the issuing process. Actually, dirty buffers inside kernel are not associated with processes.Multiple processes may dirty a single buffer. 

##### 内核回写规则

- Kernel attempts to write out data in a timely manner, which is by 'maximum buffer age', specified in centiseconds, 0.01s manner.

## 读文件的过程
##### 发出读指令

- C lib provides definitions of sys call that would be converted to trap statements at compile time.

##### 读系统调用

- user-space process is trapped into the kernel, pass through the sys call handler and handed to the read() sys call.
- kernel figures out what obj backs the given fd, then invokes the read func associated with backing obj.
- read func is part of file sys code, who does the physical readng from the file sys, return data to user-space read() call, then returns sys call handler, and copies data back to user space.
- sys call rets and process continues to exec

## append写
##### 消除潜在的竞争，自动设置文件位置

- mulitple process may race for the end of the same log file without synchronization
- append mode avoid this race condtion and ensures the file pos is always set to the end of the file in all writes, file pos is automatically updated before new read() issues.

## 同步写操作

- buffering writes provide a significant performance improvement, but application may need to ctrl when data hits the disk, at this case, performance need to traded fro synchronized operations.

## 直接I/O

- bypass the complex layer of cache, buffering and I/O management between devices and applications and perform app's own I/O management.
- e.g. database systems often prefer to perform their own caching and want to minimize the presentce of OS.
- flag O_DIRECT in open() will instructs the kernel minimize I\O managment, I\O will initiate directly from user-space buffer to device, all I\O will be sync
- the request length, buffer alignment and file offset must be integer multiples of underlying device sector size.

## 多路复用I/O

- application often need to block on more than one fd, e.g keyboard(stdin), ipc, files, GUI application may contend with hundreds of pending event in mainloop.
- thread can servicing each fd separately,but one process cannot block on more than one fd at the same time, say, if a read() system call is issued and data is not yet, process will block, no longer able to service the other fd.
- with nonblocking I/O, application can issue I/O requests that return a special error code instead of blocking, but this is inefficient since first, process needs to continually issue I/O, waiting fro one of its fd to be ready (poor design), secondly, application can not sleep, free the processor for other tasks.
- multiplexed I/O allows application to concurrently block on multiple fd, and receive notification when any one of fd becomes ready without blocking.
- work procedure of multiplexed I/O is like,
1. issue multiplexed I/O: tell process any of fd is ready for I/O
2. sleep until one or more fd is ready
3. wake up process
4. handle all fd that is ready
5. go back to sleep

## I/O的内核内幕

- VFS is a mechanism of abstraction that allows kernel to call file sys functions and manipulate file sys data without caring about the specific file sys type, so call 'common file model'.
- VFS is implemented via function pointer and object-oriented practices, the 'common model' provides a framework to which file sys in kernel must adhere. 
- VFS framework provides hooks to support reading, creating links, synchronizing and so on.
- VFS framework enable sys call read/write from/to any medium. All file sys support the same concepts, same interfaces and sys calls.
- Page cache is a in-memory store of recently accessed data from on-disk file sys, which faster the access speed and avoiding repeated disk access.
- Page cache exploits the concept of 'temporal locality', resouce accessed at one point are very likely to be accessed again in the near future.
- Page cache is the first place for kernel looks for file sys data. data is transferred from disk to cache on first time visit, later access would simply return from cache. cache operations are transparently and ensuring its data is always valid.
- Page cache is dynamic in size. I\O brings more and more data, with page cache size grows, consuming any free memory. If page cache eventually consumed all free memory, page cahce will be 'pruned', releasing the least-used pages to make room.
- Often kernel try to store data on the disk to have a larger memory foorprint, which is swap to disk a seldom-used page of process memory.
- 'prune' and 'swap' preference can be adjust via /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
- Another locality of reference is 'sequential locality', which says data is often reference sequentially. kernel provides 'page cache readahed' to take advantage of this. Reading extra data off the disk and into page cache on read request.
- Kernel handle readahead dynamicly, if it's noticed that a process is consistently using data readaheaded, kernel may enlarge the readahead window from 16 KB to 128 KB
- Page writeback is that kernel defers writes via buffers. Eventually, dirty buffers is committed to disk, synchronizing on-disk file with data in memory
- Dirty buffers are written when, free memory shrinks below a configurable threshold or a dirty buffer ages beyond a configurable threshold
- Kernel carry out writeback by 'flusher' threads, flusher will wake up and begin to commit dirty buffers to disk when above condition is true
- Buffers in kernel represented by buffer_head structure, which tracks various metadata associated with buffer
- The buffer data resides in page cache

## 相关的API(系统调用)

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
//maps the file (pathname) to a fd, file pos is to the start of file, access mode is also specified
/*
flags can be combined in bitwise-or manner
O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, or O_RDWR
O_APPEND: file pos is being updated to the end of file instead (always synchorize to the real last pos after last writes(even from another process))
O_ASYNC: a signal (e.g. SIGIO) generated when file becomes readable/writeable, only for FIFOs, pipes, sockets and terminals
O_CLOEXEC: automatically close file upon executing a new process, which is for eliminates a race condition
O_CREAT: create the file if not exist, otherwise no effect
O_DIRECTORY: target is a directory, to support opendir()
O_EXCL: cause O_CREAT to fail if file already exists, which is used to prevent race conditions on file creation
O_LARGEFILE: target files is larger than 2GB, open file using 64-bit offset for file pos
O_NONBLOCK: open file in nonblocking mode, no operations will cause process to block on I/O, it's defined for FIFOs
O_SYNC: open file for synchronous I\O, write operation will not complete until data has been physically written to disk, no effect on reads since they are already synchronous
O_TRUNC: for regular file, file will be truncated to zero length once open, do not use O_TRUNC | O_RDONLY, it's undefined
