message: "The coronavirus pandemic has studied universities to change-over to distance learning. free essay on customer service <a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>thesis statement for descriptive essay</a> essay writing service cheap uk. \r\nBut what is happening nowadays can be called an special delivery of content to listeners in self-isolation . A lot of academies  and the professors themselves were not ready for the teach online. According to a 2019 HSE study, University educators with an academic degree rate their level of proficiency in remote technologies at 3.2 points out of five. One in four persons has never utilized remote video services to take part in webinars or video conferences in the past three years. \r\nBut educators are not required to own online studying technologies. They were simply not prepared for this, although education and its new methods are the main function of colleges. Try to oblige the surgeon to do their work from home. Let him explain to the patient via Skype how to remove his appendicitis. It sounds crazy. Thus, the resourcefulness with which teachers adapt to the remote format is commendable. \r\n \r\nIn some cases it gets funny. Colleagues from regional varsities told that some professors asked to write summary by hand and send them scans for verification.In present, people communicate remotely in real time thanks to modern digital technologies, students can \"raise their hands\" with one button, they can write with a finger on a tablet as on a blackboard, and they are told: \"Please write a handwritten summary and send the scan.\" Or, for example, this case: a physical education professor asked students to shoot five-minute videos where they perform physical exercises. In spite of the fact that remote physical education training can be more original, for example, you can select of ready-made videos on YouTube, find checklists in the official domain, and teach them to play sports online, while you can't go outside anywhere. \r\n \r\nUniversity professors are faced with a lack of guidance and problems in dealing with organizational matters. Someone conduct lessons on Skype, someone -in Zoom, someone only sends lectures to WhatsApp. Some teachers record lessons on a webcam and send them to students. The quality of such materials is insufficient, and it is hard to perceive them. At least because the content on YouTube, which students are used to, is shot and edited professionally and the viewer is spoiled by the quality of video materials. \r\nThere are also difficulties with monitoring attendance. Some professors ask you to put a \" + \" in the chat, others ask  you to turn on Webcams and take screenshots of students. Against the background of all the misunderstandings and problems, one element of academic life remains unchanged - assessment. Students don't study on campus, but they will get grades, even formal ones. \r\n<a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>argumentative thesis statements</a> \r\nOnline learning  does not have these disadvantages, because it is based on a carefully designed learning process in an electronic information and educational environment. Educators have instructions, manuals, memos,checklists, templates for emails and notifications, and even presentations. Everything is thought out here-from the screen saver before the lesson to the slide with homework."
