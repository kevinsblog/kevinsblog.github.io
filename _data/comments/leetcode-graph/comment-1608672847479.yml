message: "We perceive the coloring of colorless pictures as an entertaining pastime that contributes to the development of the child's fine motor skills. However, children's coloring pages can do more! \r\nColoring as an educational activity for children plays a big role in the formation of many skills. \r\nUndoubtedly, the main purpose of coloring is to train a child's hand. This is the development of fine motor skills, mastering new skills, preparation for school and for writing. But after all, in the process of coloring, the kid himself chooses the colors, combines them with each other for compatibility, shows taste, demonstrates artistic abilities, and expresses himself. This activity to some extent disciplines the child, teaches him to perform monotonous work for a long time, to bring the work started to the end, fosters perseverance, accuracy, independence (after all, after all, it is necessary to put all the objects in their places and clean up the workplace). \r\nColoring can be a way to spend time together - sometimes adults are also not averse to coloring, remembering their childhood. And children really like it when their parents participate in their games and activities. \r\nWith the help of coloring pages, you can learn with a crumb of colors, shapes, numbers, letters. Also, older children have coloring pages with stickers, shadings, outlines, drawings - each develops the child in its own way, depending on his age. By the way, coloring is great for calming the nervous system and allows you to distract yourself from disturbing thoughts. This is a good way to divert your child's attention away from problems or stressful situations. \r\nGood example <a href=https://thebestcoloring.buzz/truck-coloring-book-pages/> Truck coloring book pages</a>"
