message: "I think everything wrote made a lot of sense.\r\n\r\nBut, consider this, suppose you added a little information? I ain't saying your content is not \r\ngood., but suppose you added a post title that grabbed a person's attention? I mean TCP/IP知识 is a little \r\nplain. You should glance at Yahoo's home page and watch how they write news headlines to grab people to open the links.\r\nYou might add a related video or a picture or two to grab people interested about what you've got to say.\r\nJust my opinion, it might bring your website \r\na little bit more interesting."
