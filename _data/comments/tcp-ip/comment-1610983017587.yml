message: "Today, I went to the beach with my children. I found a sea shell and gave it to my \r\n4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She put the shell to her ear and screamed.\r\nThere was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear. She never wants \r\nto go back! LoL I know this is entirely off \r\ntopic but I had to tell someone!"
