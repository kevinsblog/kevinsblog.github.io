message: "Today, I went to the beach with my kids. I found a sea shell and gave it to my \r\n4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She placed the shell to her ear and screamed.\r\nThere was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her \r\near. She never wants to go back! LoL I know this is entirely off topic but I \r\nhad to tell someone!"
