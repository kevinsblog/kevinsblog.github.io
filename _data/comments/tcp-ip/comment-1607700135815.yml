message: "The coronavirus pandemic has phoney universities to change-over to coolness learning. essay writing service uk <a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>english thesis</a> national service training program essay. \r\nBut what is happening nowadays can be named an special delivery of content to audience members in self-isolation . A lot of academies  and educators themselves were not prepared for the move to online. According to a 2019 HSE study, University professors with an academic degree rate their level of proficiency in remote technologies at 3.2 points out of five. One in four people has never used remote video services get  in webinars or video conferences in the past three years. \r\nBut professors are not required to own online learning technologies. They were simply not prepared for this, although education and its advanced methods are the main function of varsities. Try to oblige the surgeon to do their work from home. Let him explain to the patient via Skype how to remove his appendicitis. It sounds crazy. Thus, the resourcefulness with which professors adapt to the remote format is commendable. \r\n \r\nSometimes it gets funny. Colleagues from regional universities told that some professors asked to write conspectuses by hand and send them scans for according.Today, people communicate remotely in real time thanks to digital technologies, students can \"raise their hands\" with only one button, they can write with a finger on a tablet as on a blackboard, and they are told: \"Please write a handwritten conspectus and send the scan.\" Or, for example, this case: a physical education educator asked students to shoot five-minute videos where they show physical exercises. In spite of the fact that remote physical education training can be more unique, for example, you can select of ready-made videos on YouTube, find checklists in the official domain, and teach them to play sports in self-isolation, while you can't go outside anywhere. \r\n \r\nUniversity teachers are faced with a lack of guidance and problems in dealing with organizational matters. Someone conduct lessons on Skype, someone -in Zoom, some of them only sends lectures to WhatsApp. Some teachers record lectures on a webcam and send them to students. The quality of such materials is minimal, and it is hard to perceive them. At least because the content on YouTube, which students are used to, is shot and edited professionally and the viewer is spoiled by the quality of video materials. \r\nThere are also problems with monitoring attendance. Some educators ask you to put a \" + \" in the chat, others ask  you to turn on Webcams and take screenshots of students. Against the background of all the misunderstandings and difficulties, one element of academic life remains unchanged - assessment. Students don't get an educational experience on campus, but they will get grades, even formal ones. \r\n<a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>write my thesis</a> \r\nLearning online from home does not have these disadvantages, because it is based on a carefully designed learning process in an electronic information and educational environment. Teachers have instructions, manuals, memos,checklists, templates for emails and notifications, and even presentations. Everything is thought out here-from the screen saver before the lesson to the slide with homework."
