message: "What are CBD items? A Cannabidiol product is taken to help people \r\nwith chronic or life-threatening diseases, disorders \r\nor situations. It isn't recognized if CBD is effective in treating malignancy, as there is no \r\nrecorded data on this aspect. Nevertheless, CBD is believed to help slow \r\ndown the advancement of tumors, and reduce the size of tumors as \r\nwell as kill cancer tissue. The only real known side-effect of CBD is that it might make you \r\ndizzy. So the important matter to learn is do you want the CBD in its real state, or in a liquid, capsule or essential oil?"
