message: "Today, I went to the beachfront with my children. I found a sea shell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" \r\nShe put the shell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear.\r\n\r\nShe never wants to go back! LoL I know this is entirely off topic but \r\nI had to tell someone!"
