message: "I think that what you said made a bunch of sense. But, what about this?\r\nsuppose you wrote a catchier title? I am not saying your content \r\nisn't good, however suppose you added a post title that grabbed people's attention? I mean LeetCode专题-设计数据结构 is a little boring.\r\n\r\nYou could glance at Yahoo's home page and see how they \r\ncreate post headlines to grab people to open the \r\nlinks. You might add a video or a pic or two to get people interested about everything've written. In my opinion, it would make your posts a little livelier."
