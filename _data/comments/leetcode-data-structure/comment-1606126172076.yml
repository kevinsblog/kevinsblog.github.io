message: "Today, I went to the beach with my children. I found a sea shell and gave it \r\nto my 4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" \r\nShe placed the shell to her ear and screamed. There \r\nwas a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear. She never wants to go back!\r\nLoL I know this is completely off topic but I \r\nhad to tell someone!"
