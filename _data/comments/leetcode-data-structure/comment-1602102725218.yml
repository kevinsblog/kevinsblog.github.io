message: "Today, I went to the beach front with my children. I found \r\na sea shell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She placed the shell to her \r\near and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear.\r\nShe never wants to go back! LoL I know this is completely off topic \r\nbut I had to tell someone!"
