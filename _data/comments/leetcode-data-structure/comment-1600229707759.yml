message: "Early in the summer of 1965 the Byrds scored a number one hit with Dylan s song Mr.Melody s Echo Chamber strives for pop perfection within psychedelia in a way that recalls Brian Wilson at his most restless, each hazy synthesizer soundscape is punctuated with sun-kissed guitar lines, and each moment of dissonance is reigned back in by Prochet s psych pop allure - it s the kind of record that you pray our rapidly forgetful music-consuming culture is kind to.Bring me back your life.Oh, angels sent from up above I feel it coursing through my blood Life is a drink, your love s about To make the stars come out.What are you still standing around for. \r\n \r\nhttp://flexvelcremobuldoydondeworhardnetul.xyz/6/zappa-mothers-roxy-elsewhere-vinyl-lp-album.php"
