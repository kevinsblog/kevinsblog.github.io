message: "First of all I would like to say great blog!\r\nI had a quick question which I'd like to ask if you don't mind.\r\nI was curious to know how you center yourself and \r\nclear your thoughts prior to writing. I have had \r\ndifficulty clearing my thoughts in getting \r\nmy ideas out there. I truly do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 10 to 15 \r\nminutes are wasted simply just trying to figure out how to begin. Any \r\nrecommendations or tips? Appreciate it!"
