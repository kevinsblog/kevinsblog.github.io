message: "First of all I would like to say wonderful blog! I had a quick question which \r\nI'd like to ask if you do not mind. I was interested to know how you center yourself and clear your thoughts \r\nprior to writing. I've had difficulty clearing my thoughts in getting my thoughts out there.\r\nI truly do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes \r\ntend to be lost just trying to figure out how to begin. Any recommendations or tips?\r\nKudos!"
