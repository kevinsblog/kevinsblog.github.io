message: "I think what you posted made a bunch of sense. But, think on this, what if \r\nyou were to create a awesome headline? I ain't suggesting your content isn't good., however suppose you added a title that makes \r\npeople want more? I mean LeetCode专题-设计数据结构 is kinda vanilla.\r\nYou ought to look at Yahoo's front page and note how they create \r\narticle headlines to get people to open the links. You might add a \r\nvideo or a related picture or two to get readers interested about what \r\nyou've written. In my opinion, it could bring your posts a little bit more interesting."
