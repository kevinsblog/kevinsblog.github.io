message: "If You're Moving In State - If you're moving to \r\na new house without hopping state lines you might determine that you do \r\nnot have anything else to do with your auto insurance.  Not \r\nonly do you potentially face cancellation of the policy, but new providers might not \r\nexactly get you on being a customer.  Even if you aren't actually paying \r\nyour insurance premium and soon you get free from college,\r\nit is possible to still useful parents money by finding discount car insurance exclusively for college students."
