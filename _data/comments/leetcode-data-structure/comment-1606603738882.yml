message: "I think that everything posted made a great deal of sense.\r\n\r\nBut, think on this, what if you added a little content? I ain't suggesting \r\nyour content isn't solid., however what if you added something that makes people desire \r\nmore? I mean LeetCode专题-设计数据结构 is \r\nkinda vanilla. You ought to peek at Yahoo's front page and see how \r\nthey create article headlines to grab people to open the links.\r\nYou might add a related video or a related pic or two to get people interested about what you've written. In my opinion, it \r\ncould bring your posts a little bit more interesting."
