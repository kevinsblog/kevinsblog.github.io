message: "First of all I want to say superb blog! I had a quick question that \r\nI'd like to ask if you don't mind. I was curious to know how you center yourself and clear your mind before writing.\r\nI've had a difficult time clearing my mind in getting my thoughts \r\nout. I do enjoy writing however it just seems like \r\nthe first 10 to 15 minutes are wasted simply just trying to figure out how to begin. Any \r\nrecommendations or tips? Many thanks!"
