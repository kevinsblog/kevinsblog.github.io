message: "Today, I went to the beach with my children. I \r\nfound a sea shell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said \r\n\"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She placed \r\nthe shell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and \r\nit pinched her ear. She never wants to go back!\r\nLoL I know this is completely off topic but I had to tell someone!"
