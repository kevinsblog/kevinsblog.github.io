message: "First of all I want to say superb blog! I had \r\na quick question in which I'd like to ask if you don't mind.\r\nI was interested to find out how you center yourself and clear your mind before \r\nwriting. I've had difficulty clearing my mind in getting my thoughts out.\r\nI do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes \r\ntend to be wasted just trying to figure out how to begin. Any \r\nideas or tips? Appreciate it!"
