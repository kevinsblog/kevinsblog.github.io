message: "Hey there this is kinda of off topic but I was wondering if blogs \r\nuse WYSIWYG editors or if you have to manually code with HTML.\r\nI'm starting a blog soon but have no coding experience so I \r\nwanted to get advice from someone with experience. Any help \r\nwould be greatly appreciated!"
