message: "The coronavirus pandemic has phoney universities to lash to coolness learning. what community service means to me essay <a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>apa thesis</a> perfect essay writing service. \r\nBut what is happening nowadays can be called an crisis delivery of content to audience members in isolation . Most of varsities  and the teachers themselves were not prepared for the transition to online. According to a 2019 HSE study, University professors with an academic degree rate their level of proficiency in remote technologies at 3.2 points out of five. One in four persons has never used remote video services to take part in webinars or video conferences in the past three years. \r\nBut educators are not required to own online learning technologies. They were simply not prepared for this, although education and its modern methods are the main function of universities. Try to oblige the surgeon to do their work from home. Let him explain to the patient via Skype how to remove his appendicitis. It sounds strange. Thus, the resourcefulness with which professors adapt to the remote format is commendable. \r\n \r\nSometimes it gets funny. Colleagues from regional universities said that some teachers asked to write conspectuses by hand and send them scans for verification.Today, people communicate remotely in real time thanks to modern digital technologies, students can \"raise their hands\" with only one button, they can write with a finger on a tablet as on a blackboard, and they are told: \"Please write a handwritten summary and send the scan.\" Or, for example, this case: a physical education educator asked students to shoot five-minute videos where they perform physical exercises. In spite of the fact that remote physical excercises can be more creative, for example, you can select of ready-made videos on YouTube, find checklists in the popular domain, and teach them to play sports at home, while you can't go outside anywhere. \r\n \r\nUniversity teachers are faced with a lack of guidance and problems in dealing with organizational matters. Some of them conduct classes on Skype, someone -in Zoom, someone only sends lectures to WhatsApp. Some teachers record lessons on a webcam and send them to students. The quality of such materials is insufficient, and it is quite difficult  to perceive them. At least because the videos on YouTube, which students are used to, is shot and edited professionally and the viewer is spoiled by the quality of video materials. \r\nThere are also difficulties with monitoring attendance. Some professors ask you to put a \" + \" in the chat, others require  you to turn on Webcams and take screenshots of students. Against the background of all the misunderstandings and troubles, one element of academic life remains unchanged - assessment. Students don't study on campus, but they will get grades, even formal ones. \r\n<a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>macbeth thesis statement</a> \r\nOnline learning  does not have these disadvantages, because it is based on a carefully designed learning process in an electronic information and educational environment. Teachers have instructions, manuals, memos,checklists, templates for emails and notifications, and even presentations. Everything is thought out here-from the screen saver before the lesson to the slide with homework."
